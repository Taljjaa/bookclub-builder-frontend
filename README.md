# Bookclub Builder - Frontend

## Motivation

Bookclub Builder's goal is to encourage people to read more and unite book lovers. I wanted a simple website that allowed me to create a bookclub and decide on which books to read through poll. [This](https://github.com/Taljjaa/bookclub-builder-backend) is a link to the backend repository

## Features

-  Users can sign up and login
-  Users can join a bookclub or leave a bookclub
   -  As a member a user can vote on the current poll
-  Users can create a bookclub
   -  If you create the bookclub you're automatically set as the admin

      -  And Edit the bookclub
